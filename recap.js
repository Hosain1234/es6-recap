/* 
1. let, const use and decliar
2. template string
    a. use variable
    b. use object property
3. arrow function use and decliar every version
    a. with one parameter. will return the number after dividing by 5
    b. with two parameters. will add 2 to each number then multiply the result
    c. three parameters. will multiply all three parameters
    d. two parameter but it will be multiline arrow function. will add 2 to each number and multiply the results. Make sure it returns the result.
4. function decliaration vs arrow function different.
5. you have array of Numbers. map it go get elemrnt multiplied by 5 and must use arrow function.
